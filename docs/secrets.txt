navi's secret handling setup

navi's security model around secrets is composed of two distinct secret handling
mechanisms. As they can be layered, we will call them layer01 and layer02.

layer01 is git-crypt. It allows for public viewing of the infrastructure and
uploading of secrets, including nix files, without them being compromised, all
the while storing its versioning history. It also allows per machine, or groups of
machines for that matter, setup of keys: this way only approved machines will be
able to learn about the secret infrastructure of others, while still being able
to decrypt its own.


layer02 is agenix. Its purpose is different than git-crypt: NixOS, by design,
needs to allow world readability on its store files, which can contain built
assets of secrets by layer01. This is obviously unwanted in a case where, eg, a
private ssh key is stored and can be used as an LPE mechanism by simply reading
the /nix/store. This uses ssh keys.
