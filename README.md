navi
=====
navi(NixOS Advanced Virtual Infrastructure) is a set of NixOS configuration
files handling my own internal infrastructure. 

Currently the machines populated by this configuration are:

* alastor
* xanadu

Do not forget to run `pre-commit install` to get the formatting hooks running
before contributing!
