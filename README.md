navi
=====
navi(NixOS Advanced Virtual Infrastructure) is a set of NixOS configuration
files handling my own internal infrastructure. 

Currently the machines populated by this configuration are:

* xanadu


Features in need of development are:
* security hardening through sandboxing 
* set up eirin to have regular and automated backups
* reroute all internet traffic through tor
* make firefox sync to fujiwara and setup fujiwara
